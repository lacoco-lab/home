      title: About us
      text: We are a group of researchers investigating human language, computation, and human cognition. We are based at <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html">Saarland University</a> and <a href="https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/">Saarland Informatics Campus</a>, Germany.<br><br>Our research studies the following topics:<p></p><ul><li><p><b>Machine Learning for Language:</b> How do neural language models comprehend language? What explains their success, and what are their limitations? For example, we have investigated the expressive power of transformer models to model recursive structure (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00306">TACL 2020</a>) and probed the linguistic knowledge of language models (<a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00283">TACL 2019</a>).</p></li><li><p><b>Computational Cognitive Science:</b> How does the human mind process information, and how does this shape language? In recent work, we have augmented GPT-2  with memory limitations to examine what makes recursion difficult for humans (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2122602119">PNAS 2022a</a>), propose that grammar reflects pressures towards efficient language use (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/16/1910923117">PNAS 2020</a>,  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122604119">PNAS 2022b</a>), and have developed a unifying theory of biases in human perception across domains (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01574-x">Nature Neuroscience 2024</a>). </p> </li>
