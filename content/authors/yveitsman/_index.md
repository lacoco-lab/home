Currently I am a Master student at Saarland University, studying Language Science and Technology. I got my BA with a major in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Spanish language from American University in Bulgaria in December 2022. After working as a software engineer at VMware Bulgaria, I am now pursuing my dream of doing research. Currently, my research interests lie at the intersection of mechanistic interpretability, robust and efficient NLP, and low-resource language processing.
