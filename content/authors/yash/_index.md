I am a Master's student in the Language Science and Technology department at Saarland University.  I completed my undergrad in 2020, majoring in Computer Science at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. After internships in Novartis and Samsung, I joined Glib.ai as a Machine Learning Engineer and worked there for 3 years.

My research interest lies in delving deep into the workings of LLMs and finding potential areas of improvements. I believe there is potential in using linguistic tricks to inject worldly knowledge into LLMs, to lower training costs and data requirements, all the while increasing reliability and control. I am equally fascinated by the evolution and acquisition of language in humans and actively follow the latest discourse on the same.
