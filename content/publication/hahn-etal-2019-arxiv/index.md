abstract: 'Intuitively, human readers cope easily with errors in text; typos, misspelling,
  word substitutions, etc. do not unduly disrupt natural reading. Previous work indicates
  that letter transpositions result in increased reading times, but it is unclear
  if this effect generalizes to more natural errors. In this paper, we report an eye-tracking
  study that compares two error types (letter transpositions and naturally occurring
  misspelling) and two error rates (10% or 50% of all words contain errors). We find
  that human readers show unimpaired comprehension in spite of these errors, but error
  words cause more reading difficulty than correct words. Also, transpositions are
  more difficult than misspellings, and a high error rate increases difficulty for
  all words, including correct ones. We then present a computational model that uses
  character-based (rather than traditional word-based) surprisal to account for these
  results. The model explains that transpositions are harder than misspellings because
  they contain unexpected letter combinations. It also explains the error rate effect:
  upcoming words are more difficultto predict when the context is degraded, leading
  to increased surprisal.'
