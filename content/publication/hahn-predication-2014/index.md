abstract: We examine noun phrases and predication in Khoekhoe, a Central Khoisan language,
  arguing that members of all open word classes can function equally and without derivation
  as predicates, and that predicative use is primary and referential use is derived
  syntactically by relativization.  We then present a formal HPSG analysis, in which
  members of all open word classes enter thesyntax as predicates and in which all
  argument NPs are derived in a uniform manner as projections of pronominal elements,
  modified by relative clauses, building on Sag's (1997) analysis of English relative
  clauses. We will then argue that, additionally, DPs may project directly to clauses,
  yielding a second predication structure.
