abstract: The frequency of intensional and non-first-order definable operators in
  natural languages constitutes a challenge for automated reasoning with the kind
  of logical translations that are deemed adequate by formal semanticists. Whereas
  linguists employ expressive higher-order logics in their theories of meaning, the
  most successful logical reasoning strategies with natural language to date rely
  on sophisticated first-order theorem provers and model builders. In order to bridge
  the fundamental mathematical gap between linguistic theory and computational practice,
  we present a general translation from a higher-order logic frequently employed in
  the linguistics literature, two-sorted Type Theory, to first-order logic under Henkin
  semantics. We investigate alternative formulations of the translation, discuss their
  properties, and evaluate the availability of linguistically relevant inferences
  with standard theorem provers in a test suite of inference problems stated in English.
  The results of the experiment indicate that translation from higher-order logic
  to first-order logic under Henkin semantics is a promising strategy for automated
  reasoning with natural languages.
