abstract: Across languages, adjectives are subject to ordering restrictions. Recent
  research shows that these are predicted by adjective subjectivity, but the question
  remains open why this is the case. We first conduct a corpus study and not only
  replicate the subjectivity effect, but also find a previously undocumented effect
  of mutual information between adjectives and nouns. We then describe a rational
  model of adjective use in which listeners explicitly reason about judgments made
  by different speakers, formalizing the notion of subjectivity as agreement between
  speakers. We show that, once incremental processing is combined with memory limitations,
  our model predicts effects both of subjectivity and mutual information. We confirm
  the adequacy of our model by evaluating it on corpus data, finding that it correctly
  predicts ordering in unseen data with an accuracy of 96.2 %. This suggests that
  adjective ordering can be explained by general principles of human communication
  and language processing.
