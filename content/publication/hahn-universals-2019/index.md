abstract: 'Human languages share many grammatical properties. We show that some of
  these properties can be explained by the need for languages to offer efficient communication
  between humans given our cognitive constraints. Grammars of languages seem to find
  a balance between two communicative pressures: to be simple enough to allow the
  speaker to easily produce sentences, but complex enough to be unambiguous to the
  hearer, and this balance explains well-known word-order generalizations across our
  sample of 51 varied languages. Our results offer quantitative and computational
  evidence that language structure is dynamically shaped by communicative and cognitive
  pressures.'
