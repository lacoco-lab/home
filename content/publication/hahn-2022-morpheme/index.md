abstract: The ordering of morphemes in a word displays well-documented regularities
  across languages. Previous work has explained these in terms of notions such as
  semantic scope, relevance, and productivity. Here, we test a recently formulated
  processing theory of the ordering of linguistic units, the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis
  [Hahn et al., 2021]. The claim of the theory is that morpheme ordering can partly
  be explained by the optimization of a tradeoff between memory and surprisal. This
  claim has received initial empirical support from two languages. In this work, we
  test this idea more extensively using data from four additional agglutinative languages
  with significant amounts of morphology, and by considering nouns in addition to
  verbs. We find that the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis predicts ordering in most
  cases with high accuracy, and accounts for cross-linguistic regularities in noun
  and verb inflection. Our work adds to a growing body of work suggesting that many
  ordering properties of language arise from a pressure for efficient language processing.
