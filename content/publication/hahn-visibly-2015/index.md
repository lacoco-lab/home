abstract: We extend the familiar program of understanding circuit complexity in terms
  of regular languages to visibly counter languages. Like the regular languages, the
  visibly counter languages are NC1- complete. We investigate what the visibly counter
  languages in certain constant depth circuit complexity classes are. We have initiated
  this in a previous work for AC0. We present characterizations and decidability results
  for various logics and circuit classes. In particular, our approach yields a way
  to understand TC0, where the regular approach fails.
